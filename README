Using
=====
Edit PyleWM.py to set whatever window management hotkeys you'd like,
then execute it from its directory to activate the PyleWM window
management shortcuts.

The default shortcuts are my personal preferred ones, so you will
have to edit them to get something halfway sane.

Dependencies
============
Requires pypiwin32.

Focus Stealing
==============
Since a lot of this program deals with stealing focus from windows and
giving it to others, we need to set Windows to allow us to steal focus.
By default it'll prevent us from doing so if we don't already own the 
focused window.

To enable focus stealing, set the following registry key to 0:

    HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\ForegroundLockTimeout
